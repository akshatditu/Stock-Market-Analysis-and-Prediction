# Stock-Market-Analysis-and-Prediction

Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is the project on technical analysis, visualization and prediction using data of few S&P 500 Companies..The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit. In this report we analyze existing and new methods of stock market prediction. We take three different approaches at the problem: Fundamental analysis, Technical Analysis, and the application of Machine Learning. We find evidence in support of the weak form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, that the historic price does not contain useful information but out of sample data may be predictive. We show that Fundamental Analysis and Machine Learning could be used to guide an investorâ€™s decisions. We demonstrate a common flaw in Technical Analysis methodology and show that it produces limited useful information. Based on our findings, algorithmic trading programs are developed and simulated using Jupyter Notebook .
Another part of this project deals with the prediction of future stock price using three different Machine Learning models which can be useful for the investors to check how the stock will perform in the future.
Accuracy and efficiency are two main measures that tells us about the quality of the model.
The project is created from scratch by using the basic libraries.

The features of the project include:


i) Moving Averages of Stock.
ii) Daily Returns of Stock.
iii) Comparison of Stocks of different companies.
iv) Stock Price Prediction.
